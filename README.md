Pyvec attempts to solve a paramount issue in deep learning, the vectorisation of raw data. The idea of the project is to make vectorisation as easy as humanly possible, and to enable data scientists to focus on more important issues.

## Quick start

There are a number of ways to get started with Pyvec.

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/KeironO/Pyvec/archive/master.zip).
- Clone the repo ```git clone https://www.github.com/KeironO/Pyvec```.

## What can it do now?

* Convert images into vectors
* That's about it... for now!
